# Pet Shelter Analysis

## Introduction
"Pet Shelter Analysis" is a data-driven exploration of the Austin Animal Shelter, aiming to provide insights into patterns of animal intakes and adoptions. Utilizing a dataset from Kaggle, this project leverages Python, Pandas, and Jupyter Notebook to analyze and interpret shelter data.

## Dataset
The project uses a comprehensive dataset available on Kaggle, which includes detailed records of animal intakes and outcomes at the Austin Animal Shelter. You can access the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aaronschlegel/austin-animal-center-shelter-intakes-and-outcomes).

## Technology Stack
- **Python**: The primary language for performing data analysis.
- **Pandas**: A Python library used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An open-source web application that allows the creation and sharing of documents containing live code, equations, and narrative text.

## Features
- **Area Analysis**: Identifying areas where more pets are found to aid in targeted resource allocation and collaboration with local volunteers and animal control.
- **Monthly Intake Trends (2015)**: Assessing the average number of pets found each month in 2015, highlighting months with unusually high intakes.
- **Intake vs. Adoption Ratio**: Analyzing the ratio of incoming pets to adopted pets to gauge shelter performance.
- **Animal Type Distribution**: Examining the distribution of different animal types within the shelter.
- **Breed-Specific Adoption Rates**: Determining adoption rates for the top five dog breeds in the shelter.
- **Color-Based Adoption Rates**: Analyzing adoption rates for the top five colorings of animals in the shelter.
- **Spay/Neuter Volume Estimation**: Estimating the monthly volume of spay/neuter procedures to help with resource and staff allocation.
- **Repeat Intake Analysis**: Identifying animals that are repeat visitors to the shelter and determining the most returned animal.
- **Adoption Rates by Age Group**: Investigating adoption rates for different age groups (baby, young, adult, senior).
- **Spay/Neuter Expenditure (2015)**: Calculating the total expenditure on spay/neuter procedures for dogs and cats in 2015.
